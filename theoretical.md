## Module

## Component
### 1. What is Component?
- Each component consists of:
  - An HTML template that declares what renders on the page
  - A TypeScript class that defines behavior
  - A CSS selector that defines how the component is used in a template
  - Optionally, CSS styles applied to the template
- Components define *views*, which are sets of screen elements that Angular can choose among and modify according to your program logic and data
- Components use *services*, which provide specific functionality **not directly related to views**. Service providers can be *injected* into components as dependencies, making your code modular, reusable, and efficient.
